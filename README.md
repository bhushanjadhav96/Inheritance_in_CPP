# Inheritance_in_CPP
To understand how inheritance works in cpp.

Inheritance is used for inheriting the properties of another class.

The class from which we are inheriting the properties is called the base or parent class while the class which is inheriting is called
the child class or derived class.

Following point to remember:
When we create child class object constructor and destructor are called in following order
1)Parent/base class constructor
2)Derived/child class constructor
3)Derived/child class destructor
4)Parent/base class destructor

Following output can be seen by running the cpp file in the project.
